SNES (HD) is a Super Nintendo emulator for the Apple iPad.  It is designed to be controlled by an iPhone application named ControlPad, available at http://github.com/WoozleWrangler/ControlPad or in binary form from the Cydia repository http://wherethewoozlewasnt.com/cydia 

Some features include:
  * Fullscreen graphics
  * iPhone/iPod touch controllers
  * Up to four controllers at a time
  * Save state preview screenshots

SNES (HD) is based on ZodTTD's port of Snes9x called snes4iphone.  I have altered most of the Objective C code to suit my tastes and the differences between platforms, and have redesigned the user interface.  Zod's port can be accessed at http://github.com/zodttd/snes4iphone and is available in ad-supported and commercial versions from the Cydia store.

*** About building the project ***
Please note that the Xcode project DOES NOT WORK!  It's included because I like using the
Xcode IDE for objective C code.
You have to use the Makefile in the top level of the source directory.  
A simple "make" will result in a ControlPad.app directory which you can ssh over
to your iPad.  Note that you must have ldid installed on your system for the fake
codesigning.  If ldid is not in /usr/local/bin, you'll also need to change the LDID
variable in the makefile.  

Also, if you set the SSH_DESTINATION to something appropriate for your machine, you can
do a "make transfer" and it will copy the bundle over to your machine.  Mine is set to
root@ipad:/Applications because "ipad" is the name of my iPad on my local network. 
If you set it to the hostname or ip address of your machine, it makes testing a lot easier.

Finally, I just added a file called "logwrapper.sh" to the Resources directory.  This will
be copied over to the app bundle, and if you edit SNES4iPad-Info.plist and change the value
for CFBundleExecutable from "SNES-HD" to "logwrapper.sh", when you run the app all output from
stdout and stderr are redirected to "/tmp/snes-hd.log".  This is very useful when debugging, as
there's no way I know of to attach a GDB session to a jailbreak app.  Just run "tail -f /tmp/snes-hd.log"
in an ssh session.
